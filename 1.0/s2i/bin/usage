This is an S2I Grunt+nginx centos base image responsible for consuming a Grunt project
and running it with nginx.
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image.

Sample invocation:

s2i build git://github.com/bparees/openshift-jee-sample openshift/wildflyswarm-10-centos wildflyswarmtest

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run -p 8080:8080 wildflyswarmtest

Details:
If a pom.xml is present in the source directory, the project is built with maven and the
swarm output in target will be executed.
The default Maven build arguments can be overridden by setting MAVEN_ARGS via the "--env" argument to S2I
The default Maven build arguments can be appended by setting MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND.
